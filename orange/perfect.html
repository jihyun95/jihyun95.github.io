           <h2>A GLASS OF WATER</h2>
            <p class="habit">Wouldn't be amazing if you could improve your digestion, loose weight, keep your skin healthy and boost your energy level. All you need is water with lemon to feel better for the rest of the day. Did you know that lemon water can also prevent kidney stones, reduce bad breath and improve circulation.OK! I know that a cup of maple latte or espresso seem to be an amazing treat, but thinking about healt, the lemon water beats everything. </p>

            <h2>A MORNING WORKOUT</h2>
              <p class="habit">According to science, people who work out in the morning consume fewer unnecessary calories. Not only you will be able to loose some weight, but also your blood pressure will be lower. You should consider morning exercising, especially if you have trouble with sleeping. The more intense your day is, the better sleep you have. This habit can also improve your brain, increasing the response speed and boost memory.</p>

              <h2>FOOD</h2>
              <p class="habit">After workout, finally there is time to eat delicious breakfast. My recommendation is oatmeal with nuts, granola and fresh fruits. </p>
              <p class="habit">Again! YOU CAN LOOSE SOME WEIGHT! Isn't amazing? Oats are incredibly nutritious, because they are rich in antioxidants and a powerful soluble fiber called beta-glucan. They are responsible for improving blood sugar control.</p>
